# Blogging App Frontend

A modern React-based frontend for a blogging application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete blog posts.

## Approach

This blogging application was developed to provide a clean, user-friendly interface for bloggers to manage their content. The approach focused on:

1. **Component-Based Architecture**: Using React's component model to create reusable UI elements
2. **State Management**: Implementing authentication and data persistence using React hooks and localStorage
3. **Responsive Design**: Building a mobile-friendly interface using Bootstrap
4. **RESTful API Integration**: Connecting to a backend API for data operations
5. **Protected Routes**: Implementing route protection for authenticated users
6. **User Experience**: Creating intuitive navigation and feedback mechanisms

The application follows a modern single-page application (SPA) architecture, with client-side routing and state management. The authentication system uses JWT tokens for secure API access.

## AI Usage in Development

During the development of this application, AI tools were leveraged to enhance productivity:

- **ChatGPT**: Utilized for debugging assistance, code optimization suggestions, documentation generation, REST API integration CKEditor integration and configuration.
